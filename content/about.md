# About

<div class="image-right">
<div>

I'm Steve, and I've been tinkering with synthesizer DIY since 2023. On
this website I will document my various synth projects, post updates
about new work I'm doing, and collect the various DIY electronics and music
theory resources that I've come across that others may find useful when getting
started building synthesizers.

Some other places around the internet you can find me:
- [gridbugs.org](https://www.gridbugs.org), my more general blog
- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@gridbugstv/videos), where I mostly upload synth demos
- [github](https://github.com/gridbugs), where I host the code and design for my various synth projects, notably [CAW](https://github.com/gridbugs/caw), the [modular briefcase synth](https://github.com/gridbugs/briefcase-synth), [llama (the precursor to CAW)](https://github.com/gridbugs/llama), and [this website](https://github.com/gridbugs/purpleearthhypothesis.com)
- [mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@gridbugs), come say hi!

I can also be emailed at admin AT gridbugs DOT org.
